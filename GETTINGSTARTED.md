# Introduction
Scpel is a programming language that introduces semantics and functionality around mathematical interpretations of neural science concepts, making it easy for the programmer to directly interact with neurons, which are the brain's basic units of information processing and transfer in code.

With Scpel, we aim to explore the possibility of creating artificially intelligent but self-conscious computer software that learns and adapts on any supported hardware it is deployed to with little or no intervention.

# Features
A systems reflective meta programming language
Mathematical interpretations of neural science concepts
Direct interaction with neurons
Self-conscious software that learns and adapts on any supported hardware
